            <h5>Nadhamunigal and the Compilation of "Nalayira Divyaprabandham" - A Tamil Vedha for Sree Vaishnavites</h5>
            <p>A Tamil Veda for Sri Vaishnavites - Sri Vaishnavites worship "Nalaayira Divyaprabandham" as holy as Vedas. They call it as Tamil Veda. Over a period time all the hymns sung by all the Azhwars were lost. One fine day, when Saint Nadhamunigal were worshipping the Almighty at Thirukkudanthai Divyadesam - Sarangapani Temple, the third Divyadesams among the 108 in Kumbakonam, he had a chance to hear some of the pasurams starting with “Aaraa Amudhe“ by some devotees .</p>
